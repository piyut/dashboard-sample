# dashboard-sample
To start with sample dashboard, you should do the following steps: clone sample dashboard [here](https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample), or just copy the following code.

git clone https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample.git
cd dashboard-sample

Before running the sample app on your local, first, you need to install composer.
- composer install
- php -S localhost:8000

Now you have successfully run the sample dashboard. But please be noted that the sample app is running using our App ID. If you want the sample dashboard to be connected to your app with your own App ID, you need to change App ID and Secret Key inside sample dashboard code. You can find your own App ID and Secret Key in your own Qiscus SDK dashboard.
