# Getting Started With Sample Dashboard

![Dashboard Sample Page](https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample/blob/master/img/1512532707-list+user.png)

If you have your own chat app, you may be wondering how you can manage your users. In this case, we provide a sample dashboard for user management. This sample dashboard can help you to figure out how to work with Qiscus Server Api for more advanced functionalities. You can go to https://www.qiscus.com/documentation/rest/list-api to know more about Server API.


> Note: We assume that you have already downloaded the sample app. The sample app will be needed to work together with the sample dashboard.


You can explore the [sample dashboard](http://dashboard-sample.herokuapp.com/login) to try it online, or you also can download the source code to deploy it locally or to your own server.

To start trying the sample dashboard on your end, you should carry out the following steps:
Clone sample dashboard in our [github](https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample), or just copy the following code.
```
git clone https://github.com/qiscus/dashboard-sample.git
cd dashboard-sample
```
Before running the sample app on your local, you need to first install composer.
```
composer install
php -S localhost:8000
```

The sample dashboard provided Client API to enable your sample app get list of users. This API is based on PHP and used Composer as its dependency manager. Thus, you need to have PHP and composer installed to use the API.


Now you would have successfully run the sample dashboard. However, do note that the sample app is running using our App ID. If you want the sample dashboard to be connected to your app with your own App ID, you need to change the App ID and Secret Key in the sample dashboard login page. You can find your own App ID and Secret Key in your own [Qiscus SDK dashboard](https://www.qiscus.com/dashboard).

If you are wondering how our sample app with dashboard works, here are some illustrations:

There are 4 API that are provided inside Qiscus Sample Dashboard:

1. ```.//localhost:8000/api/contacts``` to get list of users for web.
2. ```.//localhost:8000/api/login_or_register``` to enable user login or register.
3. ```.//localhost:8000/api/update_profile``` to update user profile.
4. ```.//localhost:8000/api/mobile/contacts``` to get list of users for mobile app (Android and iOS).

The Sample Dashboard called these APIs inside index.php file. To use these APIs, you need to pass your APP ID, Secret Key inside file .env.
> Note: if you need add more api you want, you just adding in the file index.php

You need pass var baseUrl inside main.js file which is located in /js folder:

```var baseUrl = "http://localhost:8000"```

To set method and request parameter, you can refer to [Qiscus Server API Documentation](https://www.qiscus.com/documentation/rest/list-api) on “Get User List”, “Update User Profile” and “Login and Register” section.

The Sample Dashboard also provided API for (Android and iOS) client app to get list of users from the Sample Dasboard.
To enable your (Android and iOS) client app to get list of users, you need to pass your domain name when calling the API.
```
//your-domain.com/api/mobile/contacts
Example: //dashboard-sample.herokuapp.com/api/mobile/contacts
```

You will get the response as follow:
```
{
   "results":{
      "meta":{
         "total_data":123,
         "total_page":6
      },
      "users":[
         {
            "avatar_url":"https:\/\/d1edrlpyc25xu0.cloudfront.net\/kiwari-prod\/image\/upload\/75r6s_jOHa\/1507541871-avatar-mine.png",
            "created_at":"2017-12-05T08:07:58.405896Z",
            "email":"tesweqeq",
            "id":452773,
            "name":"tesweqeq",
            "updated_at":"2017-12-05T08:07:58.405896Z",
            "username":"tesweqeq"
         }
      ]
   },
   "status":200
}
```
